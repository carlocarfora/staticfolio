###### Saraya

This was for a development in Oman. The project scope was huge, over 
the course of 4 months 8 different animations were created as well as 
dozens of stills.

The animation for Hotel 2 I co-led with a colleague, detailing up 
master plan level shots for close-ups as well as seting up a loose 
narrative.

My roles included the usual model/shade/render as well as some grading 
and editing. There was also a lot of render wrangling with this project 
due to the heavy nature of the scenes.
