###### Gems Singapore

This was a huge project with a dozen or so stills, an animation and an 
interactive tour with 48 360 panoramas in 6 weeks.

Me and a colleague co-led the project, I worked across all areas; 
modelling/shading/lighting/rendering as well as authoring the 
interactive tours using some in-house software and Nuke.
