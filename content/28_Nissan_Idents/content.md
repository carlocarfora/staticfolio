## Nissan Idents

Role: 3D/FX Artist  
Studio: The Mill  
Year: 2018  

On this project I was tasked with creating a growing digital "data" representation 
that became the football player. Using Houdini I was able to grow parts of the 
body and create many different passes to achieve an organic yet digtal feel 
throughout.

Software used: Houdini / Mantra / Nuke
