###### Blackfriars Station Fly-Through

At [RewindFX](http://www.rewindfx.com) I worked on creating a full CG 
flythrough of the newly designed Blackfriars station in London. I 
worked on and assisted with modelling, shading, texturing and rendering 
shots. The project was completed within a very tight schedule.
