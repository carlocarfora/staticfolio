## Code

Here you can find some of the tools I have created over the years since my 
journey into coding started in 2014. I have previous experience with Maxscript 
and now use mainly Python with some VEX in Houdini. You can find more on my [Github][1]

#### cc-pipe

cc-pipe is a small home pipeline based on my experience from working at various 
studios. It uses a shot based workflow and though written primarily for Houdini 
and Nuke can be extended to work with other software. Written in Python 3 and 
uses PyQt5 for the GUI.

Features:  
 * Folder based shot workflow
 * Project based metadata
 * Passes shot/task information to dcc application
 * Handles project management through GUI
 * Lightweight
