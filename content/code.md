## Code

Here you can find some of the tools I have created over the years. I have previous experience with Maxscript and now use mainly Python and VEX in Houdini. You can find more on my [Github][1]

#### cc-pipe

cc-pipe is a small home pipeline based on my experience from working at various 
studios. It uses a shot based workflow and though written primarily for Houdini 
and Nuke can be extended to work with other software. Written in Python 3 and 
uses PyQt5 for the GUI.
