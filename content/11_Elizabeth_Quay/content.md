## Elizabeth Quay

Elizabeth Quay has been the flagship development of the current Perth government. 

As Lead Artist I worked on all aspects of the project from pre-production through to 
the usual roles modelling/shading/lighting/rendering. There were a large amount of 
marketing, planning and proposal images created which I was also responsible for.
