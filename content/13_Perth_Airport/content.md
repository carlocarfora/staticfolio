## Perth Airport

An interesting one to work on, the scope of the idea being one 
continous camera made it a challenge as well as the scale of 
the project.

The project really pushed the farm to it's limits, as well as making it 
difficult to work on a single workstation but it was a good lesson in 
optimization and efficiency. Some nice effects were achieved using SSS 
for massing models too.

I initially began blocking out the master plan before the team ramped 
up to 4-5 people on it full time. My roles included lots of modelling 
and prop placement, shading, lighting and rendering as well as some 
detailed modelling for the fly through camera. I also authored a 360 
tour of the project.
