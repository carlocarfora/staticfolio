## Car on Fire

Role: VFX Artist  
Studio: N/A
Year: 2017  

Constructed 3D environment from photo plate, simulated fire and animated camera to bring into comp. All 3d work done in Houdini, rendered in Mantra and comp in Nuke.

You can find a stripped down Houdini file for download, it's the entire scene which includes the model. I could not include the HDRI and backplate since I did not make those.
