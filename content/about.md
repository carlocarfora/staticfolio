## About

I am a mid-weight CG/VFX Generalist with a current focus on Lighting, Rendering, 
FX and Houdini. With over 8 years of professional industry experience across 
the UK and Australia, I am currently based in London.

I have worked on producing a wide range of digital media including VFX, 
architectural visualisation, scripted tools and more.

My aim is to work on projects that push the boundaries of my skills, enable me 
to learn and grow, work hard both as a team player and individually while 
striving to produce something everybody can be proud of.

#### Skills

Familiar with a production pipeline my strengths are in Lighting, Rendering, FX 
and general TD tasks. I'm experienced with Linux and Windows operating systems. 

#### Software

Houdini, Mantra, Nuke, 3ds Max, Maya, V-Ray, Arnold, After Effects, Photoshop, Premiere

#### Scripting

Python, PyQt, Maxscript

#### Downtime

In my personal time you can usually find me working on 3D projects, exploring 
and learning new tools and techniques in Houdini or Python.

When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer I like to be outdoors, pick up my 
guitar, take photos(when travelling!), drink tea, read, make lists and generally 
keep myself productive!
