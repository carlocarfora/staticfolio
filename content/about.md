## About Me

I'm a 3D / FX Artist with over 7 years of professional industry experience in London and Australia.

So far over the course of my career, I have worked as a generalist on a wide and varied range of projects from Architecture to TVC and Film. I'm quick to learn new skills, adapt to project workflows and enjoy solving any technical issues should they arise.

My aim is to work on projects that push the boundaries of my skills, enable me to learn and grow, work hard both as a team player and individually while striving to produce something everybody can be proud of!

## Skills

Familiar with the production pipeline from modelling to comp my strengths lie in; Scene
Assembly, Lighting, Rendering, FX and general TD tasks.

I have a working knowledge of using Python, VEX and Maxscript. 

## Software

Houdini, 3ds Max, V-Ray, Nuke, After Effects, Photoshop, Premiere

## Downtime

In my personal time you can usually find me working on 3D projects, exploring 
and learning new tools and techniques primarily in Houdini.

When I’m not in front of my computer I like to be outdoors, pick up my 
guitar, take photos(when travelling!), drink tea, read, make lists of 
things that may (or may not) get done and generally keep myself productive!
