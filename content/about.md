## About

Based in London with professional industry experience both in the UK and Australia, over my career I've been fortunate enough to work across a broad range of the 3D industry landscape from Architecture to VFX.

As a Lighting and Rendering Supervisor at [The Mill][1], I take on a range of tasks helping the department deliver projects efficiently and to the high Mill standard. I have some technical ability in scripting and problem solving to help find solutions in a production environment . 

#### Skills

Familiar with the production pipeline my strengths are in Lighting, Rendering, FX 
and general TD tasks.

Experienced with Linux and Windows operating systems. 

#### Software

Houdini, Mantra, Nuke, 3ds Max, Maya, V-Ray, Arnold

#### Scripting

Python, PyQt

#### Downtime

In my personal time you can usually find me working on a personal project or two; exploring and learning new tools and techniques in Houdini, Python and more recently C++.

When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer I like to be outdoors, pick up my 
guitar, take photos, drink tea, read, make lists and generally stay productive!
