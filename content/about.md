## About Me

I am a 3D Artist with a focus on *FX* and *proceduralism* using *Houdini*. With over 7 years of professional industry experience across the UK and Australia, I am now based in London.

So far I have held various roles from 3D Generalist to FX and Lead on a wide and varied range of projects from Architecture to TVC and Film. I now focus my skills and efforts on FX and content creation in Houdini.

My aim is to work on projects that push the boundaries of my skills, enable me to learn and grow, work hard both as a team player and individually while striving to produce something everybody can be proud of.


## Skills

Familiar with the production pipeline from modelling to comp my strengths are; 

* 3D Generalist Skills (model, shade, light, render)
* Proceduralism
* FX
* General TD tasks


I have a working and usable knowledge of Python, VEX and Maxscript.

Experience with Linux and Windows operating systems.


## Software

Houdini, Mantra, Nuke, 3ds Max, V-Ray, After Effects, Photoshop, Premiere


## Downtime

In my personal time you can usually find me working on 3D projects, exploring 
and learning new tools and techniques in Houdini.

When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer I like to be outdoors, pick up my 
guitar, take photos(when travelling!), drink tea, read, make lists of 
things that may (or may not) get done and generally keep myself productive!
