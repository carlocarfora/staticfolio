## About

I am a CG/FX Artist based in London with over 8 years of professional industry experience both in the UK and Australia.

Currently working in commercials, I focus on Lighting/Rendering and FX primarily in Houdini. I have some technical ability in VEX, scripting and pipelining to help projects run as smoothly as possible.

#### Skills

Familiar with the production pipeline my strengths are in Lighting, Rendering, FX 
and general TD tasks. I'm also comfortable putting together pre-comps for lighting/FX.

Experienced with Linux and Windows operating systems. 

#### Software

Houdini, Mantra, Nuke, 3ds Max, Maya, V-Ray, Arnold

#### Scripting

Python, PyQt, Maxscript

#### Downtime

In my personal time you can usually find me working on a project or two; exploring 
and learning new tools and techniques in Houdini, Python and more recently C++.

When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer I like to be outdoors, pick up my 
guitar, take photos(when travelling!), drink tea, read, make lists and generally stay productive!
