###### About Me

Hello, I'm a 3D/FX Artist from London currently living in Perth, Australia. 
I have over 6 years of professional experience working on a wide range of 
projects from Architecture to Commercials.

Starting my career at a small boutique studio, I moved on to honing my 3D 
skills at one of the top architectural visualisation studios in the heart of 
London. I was fortunate enough here to help create images for some of the most 
iconic buildings in the UK.

In late 2012 I left London to take an extended break; eventually settling in 
Perth, Australia. I've been working here since as a senior artist on 
some of the biggest architectural projects here to date, as well as 
assisting with the VFX arm of the studio when needed.

After 4+ years focused on Arch Viz, my interest and passion has gravitated 
towards FX in Film/TV. I'm looking forward to future opportunites 
in this field.

###### Skills

Familiar with all aspects of production from modelling through to rendering 
and comp, specialising in:

* Scene Assembly
* Lighting
* Rendering
* FX
* Knowledgeable in Maxscript and Python


###### Software

Houdini, 3ds Max, V-Ray, Nuke, After Effects, Photoshop, Premiere


###### Downtime

In my personal time you can usually find me working on 3D projects, exploring 
and learning new tools and techniques primarily in Houdini.

When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer I like to be outdoors, pick up my 
guitar, take photos(when travelling!), drink tea, read, make lists of 
things that may (or may not) get done and generally keep myself productive!
