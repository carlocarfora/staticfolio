###### Resources

I have a [bitbucket][1] account where you can find various maxscripts 
I've written. I also have some other stuff sitting on there including the 
Python code for my static site generator which generated this website.

Also, I am attempting to organise the information I have noted down over the 
years into a [wiki][5] for personal reference but is publicly available.

###### Articles

Some blog posts that I've written are long-form and rather 
than let them get lost in the ether they are linked below for easy 
future access:


[Useful Programs and Tools][2]

[Corona Interiors write-up (alpha version of Corona)][3]

[Setting up a home linux server][4]
