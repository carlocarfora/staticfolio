Role: Compositor  
Studio: Last Pixel  
Year: 2013  

I was a compositor for the Telemovie “An Accidental Soldier” at 
[Last Pixel Studios](http://www.lastpixelstudios.com.au/). Using Nuke I 
worked on a variety of shots ranging from post camera effects to 
stitching multiple takes and roof/signage/object removal/replacement. 

The film was nominated for 6 AACTA awards including “Best Telefeature 
or Mini Series” and "Best Use of Visual FX" at the Annual WA Screen 
Awards.
