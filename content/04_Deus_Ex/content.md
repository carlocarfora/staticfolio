## Deus EX: HR Apartment Homage

This project had been sitting on my HDD for a long time, I started it 
a few years ago but it never got finished. Going through my old files, 
I found it and decided with a little bit of work it could at least 
see the light of day.

Personal project using 3DS Max, Vray, Nuke. Music from Deus Ex: HR 
Soundtrack.
