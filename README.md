README
=======

Staticfolio is a static site generator written in Python, which doesn't aim to do much more then generate a simple portfolio website.

It was written primarily as a learning project in Python so feel free to look at it, take it apart and do whatever you may with it. 

It's quite specific in use and there's probably a hundred better ways to accomplish what I did but it does work!

Credits

This project wouldn't be possible without the awesome minimal css boilerplate 
project [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/). Also used is the ever popular 
library [Jquery](http://jquery.com/) and for the grid layout, the library 
[Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) was used. Mistune was used to handle the parsing of Markdown, PIL for resizing images and I think that may be all.
