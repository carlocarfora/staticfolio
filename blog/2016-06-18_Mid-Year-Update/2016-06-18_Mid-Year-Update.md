Been one of the busiest years of my life so far, so it's been a bit quiet here 
but I'm alive and kicking. Will keep this post work related so here's what's 
been happening below:

I've been busy studying Houdini, and there are a few projects on my portfolio 
now which are 100% Houdini. My Vimeo account has been getting more popular 
which has been a real boost to my morale, I'm a lot more confident now of 
being on the right track to landing a Houdini role in the future and will keep 
updloading work as much as I can.

Spent a few days updating my website, has had a nice makeover and I've also 
written my own static blog generator in Python so no more need for Ghost. It 
was an awesome platform, but took up a LOT of my webspace. Real overkill for 
what I use it for. Parsing the json and retrieving my posts in markdown 
was a breeze in Python, a real painless task!

More to come soon, have been getting stuck into Pyro so expect some fire 
videos very soon.
