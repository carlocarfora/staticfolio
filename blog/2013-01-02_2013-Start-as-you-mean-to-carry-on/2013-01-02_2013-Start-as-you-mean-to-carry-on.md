What a year 2012 was: some of the best memories so far coupled with the decision to leave the UK and come to Australia has made it the most eventful year of my life.Â Moving into 2013, I feel that it's important to start the year on the right foot. That means keeping productive, making some attainable small goals that can blossom into bigger positive changes and enjoying myself while doing so!

My career has been something I've been trying to push forward for some time now. It's been difficult at times to stay motivated, and as other aspects of life crept in I probably can admit to myself that I didn't put in the effort I should have. How many times did i say I'll work on that awesome 3D shot or image, learn a new skill, and end up not doing it? Too many times.

Unexpectedly, I found immense motivation through my new job here which has reignited my passion for what I do. It's also shown me there's an awesome lifestyle to be led, if you can balance work/play and work smarter. To this end, I've taken it into my own hands to start 2013 as the most productive year for my career yet. How?
<h3>FXPHD</h3>
I've wanted to join this website for a while, from reading all the awesome reviews about it but have always made excuses not to. WellÂ  no more of that, I'm officially enrolled on:
<ol>
	<li>HOU102: Introduction to Houdini 12, Part 1</li>
	<li>HOU103: Introduction to Houdini 12, Part 2</li>
	<li>HOU206: Houdini FX TD Fundamentals</li>
</ol>
I'll be writing about my experience and progress with FXPHD as the course term goes on so expect to hear much more about that in the coming weeks.
<h3>Digital Tutors</h3>
I was fortunate enough to be given a group login for digital tutors from work, and now have access to even more training than I could have possibly expected. It's another push in the right direction, and keeping a steady pace on digital tutors will be another big productivity boost. It's already been of great use with a recent project at work, and I'm sure it's going to really get me motivated to work more.
<h3>One more thing...</h3>
Some final thoughts for this post, it's been a while since I was active in any CG forum and I feel like it's distanced me from the thriving CG community. I'm an onlooker now rather than an active member, so joining a forum and embracing the community is also a big goal. AtÂ university, I probably spent more time on Polycount soaking in knowledge than in lectures and it was great. I'll write what forum I've joined in my next post!
