You may have noticed a colour change, decided to update the website and make it fully responsive. It's amazing how many people use their phones now to access the internet, so it was a much overdue fix! 

I've updated all my social media, this website is now hosted on Github (so good might write a blog post about that in the future) and a new showreel should be coming very soon.

Lots more to write about, will try to structure it all into something cohesive as the blog has been lacking in good content as of late!
