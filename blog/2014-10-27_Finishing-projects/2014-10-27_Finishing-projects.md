I have a bad habit of starting projects and never finishing them, I have so many sitting around on hard drives that will never see the light of day. After replaying Deus Ex: HR, I revisited one of my previous projects that was inspired by the game. 

It wasn't far from being done, so with a few evenings/weekends and some time for rendering I finished it and it's now sitting on my vimeo page.

Picking this project back up, I can see how much I've learnt since then. It was a very unoptimised scene, with the render settings not really tweaked with a thorough understanding of Vray. After a day or 2 of optimising it was rendering within a much more acceptable time.

Even so, rendering on my humble i5 desktop with 8gb of RAM took a while so I only really had one shot at it and had to fix anything that was wrong in post!

Next up is a Corona interior, should be a lot of fun getting it together and I'll be aiming for photorealism with this one. Possibly even a couple of animated shots should render times be acceptable enough!
