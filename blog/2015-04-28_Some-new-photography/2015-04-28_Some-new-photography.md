Here's some recent photography from a friends farm in rural WA. Shot on my usual gear which is an Olympus OMD-EM5 paired with a 20mm f1.7 Panasonic Lumix. 

I've shot a lot with this simple combo and love it for being able to grab a large variety of shots. I never feel restricted using a single focal length, and find it means I work harder to get the shot framed up the way I want!
