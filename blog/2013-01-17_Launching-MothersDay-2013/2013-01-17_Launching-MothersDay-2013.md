Last year me and <a href="http://www.michaelcharalambous.com">Michael Charalambous </a> one of my close friends from home launched a website for mothers day and it was ultimately a success. With 350,000 unique visitors and coming top not only for it's targeted search term but also others it was great fun to work on and watch.

I'm happy to say that <a href="http://www.MothersDay2013.co.uk">MothersDay2013.co.uk</a> has launched, and we think that it'll have the same sort of impact; helping people to find presents easily and narrowing down your options to choosing the perfect gift! Give it a visit if you're curious or need some ideas for what to get your mum for mothers day :)
