The first update of the new year are photos from my 2 month trip back to the UK and up the Australian East Coast, Sydney to Cairns to be exact! Getting away from the day to day of being on a computer is something everyone needs from time to time, and after a year straight of hard work Â 2 months off was definitely appreciated!

The full set of photos are below, to check out more of the photos head over to my <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/carlo_c" target="_blank">Flickr</a>, they were all shot with an Olympus OM-D EM-5.
