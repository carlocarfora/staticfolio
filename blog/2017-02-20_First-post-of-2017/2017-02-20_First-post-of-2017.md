It's a late start to 2017 here, there's been some updates to my portfolio with a few new freelance projects up and I've taken down some older work that didn't reflect my current direction and ability anymore.

There's a couple of Houdini projects in the pipeline; I'm working on some VFX for a short film here in Perth and also starting to put some time into other porfolio pieces. Looking forward to sharing some progress here when there is more to show :)
