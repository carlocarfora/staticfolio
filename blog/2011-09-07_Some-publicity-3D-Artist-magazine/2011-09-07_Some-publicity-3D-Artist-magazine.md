It's been a quiet couple of months on here, work and summer seem to have come and gone in a whirl of 3D and (just about) some sun!

Something that I'm really happy to blog about though is being in the latest issue (32) of 3D Artist! I've attached the clipping below, and I'm really glad to have been in this issue and for the opportunity that they gave me. A personal thanks goes to Lynette Clee!
