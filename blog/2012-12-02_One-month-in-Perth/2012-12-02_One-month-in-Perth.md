Well it's been about a month here, I figured I'd write up some more thoughts and opinions on what it's like here, and some of the things I've been getting up to here.

Perth, and the rest of WA seems like a very exciting place to be at the moment. The whole area is expanding quite rapidly, everywhere you look there's some sort of building project taking place. There's new suburbs being built, government incentives to get people buying houses and you get a real sense of Perth growing.

There's also lots to do here if you like being outdoors. Most of my weekends since getting here have been spent out and about, and while I'm still trying to see sights at least one day out of the weekend there's just so much to see! This also brings me to my next point...

Everything is so <strong>far away from each other! </strong>

A couple of hours drive is nothing here, 4-5 is maybe something to turn your head to lol only when we start talking about 10+ hours do people start saying it's a long drive. You <strong>need a car</strong> here to really start seeing things, I've yet to get one but rest assured it'll be a gumtree beauty when I do!

So far I've only been as far north as the Pinnacles, which is barely north really lol and I haven't even been down south at all yet. I'm sure that'll change over the coming months though.

As well as the Pinnacles I've also visited Lancelin a couple of times, where you can go <strong>sand boarding</strong> (yes, really!) and if you're into it apparently it's great for water sports like kite surfing. Pretty much every beach I've been to here has been amazing, I don't actually think you can go wrong with a beach here in WA which is pretty awesome.

The cost of WA compared to the UK does take a bit of getting used to, things that were relatively cheap back home cost almost extortionate amounts to me but it's just the cost of life here. Looking at <a href="http://m.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jun/12/city-cost-of-living-2012-tokyo">this</a> 2012 data, Perth jumped to overtake London this year and it definitely is noticeable. Be warned, save before you come over here!

I'll finish off though by saying so far it's awesome place to be, to live, and to meet new people. I have to give a mention to <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">couch surfing</a> here because it's just such an awesome way to meet new people. You don't even have to use the service to "surf couches", just using it to go to meets and find people to see sights with is brilliant. My friend wrote a good piece on his couch surfing experiences <a href="http://www.michaelcharalambous.com/travel/couchsurfing-org-great-people-great-reasons-great-idea/">here</a>.

Expect a barrage of photos next, finally finished up 2 rolls of film so those will be up next!
