I've spent most of this year working exclusively in Houdini in my personal time, going through some of the awesome tutorials and courses available now while also becoming familiar with the way you think about approaching problems compared to 3ds Max.

Here's a little dump of gif, video and imagery from the tuts I've followed, I'm now working on my own personal project which I'll post up when there's some real progress to be shown!
