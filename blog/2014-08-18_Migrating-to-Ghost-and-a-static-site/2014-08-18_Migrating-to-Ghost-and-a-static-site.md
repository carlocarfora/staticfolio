I'm currently in the process of moving my website from Wordpress to a (very simple) custom written static site generator, and to keep the blogging aspect intact I've installed Ghost as the platform of choice. 

There were a few reasons for this, but the ability to effortlessly import wordpress posts was one of the main ones. So far I'm really enjoying it's minimal approach and the ability to write posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is great!

I'm super busy at the moment with work but as things calm down I should be able to deploy my new site, it'll be a major update with new work and as it'll be much less work to maintain (no more constant updating Wordpress + plugins!) I will have more drive to keep it updated.
