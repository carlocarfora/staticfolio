So it's been a week in Perth, and I thought I'd write a little blog post on what's been happening and what to expect from here in the future!

Firstly, the flight to Australia from the UK is as bad as everyone says it is! It's the second plane that really got me, spending more time in my stopover would have made a big difference and I think I'll bear that in mind for any future long haul flights with a stop. Singapore has a lovely airport and it's worth spending more than 2 hours there to take it all in!

Getting over the flight, time difference and being on the other side of the world took about 4 days, but some of the most important things done are:
<ul>
	<li>Setting up a bank account</li>
	<li>Applying for a tax file number (TFN)</li>
	<li>Getting an idea of the job market situation</li>
</ul>
Hopefully with some luck andÂ perseveranceÂ getting a job won't take too long, there's only so long I can sit around and soak up the sun before needing to pay my way here!

Took a trip to Rottnest Island on Saturday with my friend and his family, who are being kind enough to put me up while I let my feet settle here in Perth. It was a lovely place, managed to bike around the whole island with a baby trailer on the back of the bike so it was hard work up and over all the hills!

Incredible beaches and they have these animals called <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quokka" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quokka" target="_blank">Quokkas</a> which are native to the island. When people first discovered the island and Quokkas they thought they were giant rats, which is where the name comes from.

The snaps they are just from my phone. Hopefully when I develop my first roll of film here I'll have better photos to put up (though I'm not holding my breath as I'm going to try and self develop it!)

As for what this blog will bring in the foreseeable future; it'll probably be a mixture of my travel adventures and creative pursuits. Hopefully someone out there will find them interesting!
