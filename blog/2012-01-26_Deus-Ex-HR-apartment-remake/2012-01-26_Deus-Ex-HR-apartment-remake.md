I started work on this before Christmas but didn't really spend as much time as I should have on it. I had just completed Deus EX: HR (brilliant game, if your a fan of the Deus Ex series definitely check it out) and was inspired by the artwork.

I decided to pay homage to it by re-creating an environment to cinematic quality, and what better setting than his apartment. It's still early days, but I will be posting updates to this as it progresses and hopefully put together a making of when it is complete. Current state of project is below:
