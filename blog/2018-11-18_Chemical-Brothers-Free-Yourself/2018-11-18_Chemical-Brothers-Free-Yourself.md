With the latest project that I worked on out in the wild, I thought it deserves a bit of a post 
as it's one I'm quite proud to have worked on and was a real fun one!

I was responsible for lighting and rendering on the latest Chemical Brothers music video for their 
song "Free Yourself". There was a lot to get through with a small team of 4 lighting and it was a 
real race to the finish to get it all rendered and over to 2D for their magic.

The entire project was rendered in Houdini with Arnold 5, along the way various bugs and issues 
popped up that required solving/fixing so it was a great opportunity to get some problem solving 
done too. I'll be sure to add the making of to the portfolio as well once it's out too.

It was a big team effort throughout, well done to everone involved for having it done and out!
