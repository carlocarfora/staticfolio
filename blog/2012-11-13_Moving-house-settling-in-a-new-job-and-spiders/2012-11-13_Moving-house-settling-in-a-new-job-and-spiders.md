It's been an eventful 2 weeks, and I've held off writing this blog post until I could confirm it but as of right now I'm now employed in Australia! It's such a huge feeling of relief to know I can now plan for some bigger ideas and will have steady work here.

Funny enough, I'm doing what I did back in the UK here so my skills won't be left to stagnate. From what I've seen so far of the company, it looks like I'll be using my whole range of skills and more which is really exciting. Always love learning new things :)

So how did I manage to get a job so quickly? I'll be the first to say I was pretty lucky, right place at the right time (or right website at the right time!) but I had a logical approach which could help anyone either job hunting or tackling a task that seems daunting.

<strong>Break it down</strong>

It's as simple as that, I can't stress that enough! Just break it down into a bullet point list of things to do and cross them off one at a time. My big job hunting task became something like:
<ul>
	<li>Update CV</li>
	<li>Write list of websites/places to find work
<ul>
	<li>gumtree</li>
	<li>hays</li>
	<li>seek</li>
	<li>WA paper</li>
	<li>adecco</li>
	<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Save job ad web pages into a folder for each website</li>
	<li>Write cover letter for each job</li>
	<li>Email job ad, note down in a spreadsheet who it's sent to and log any replies</li>
	<li>Phone any ad's with numbers</li>
	<li>Walk/bus/train to large shopping centres and shops to hand CV's to</li>
	<li>Note down who takes them</li>
</ul>
I've written that list off the top of my head, with what I can remember but it's pretty much that. I just broke down the task into as many small tasks as I could and went through each one. Doesn't have to be all done in one day, but as long as you're crossing things off it's progress! A list of things all ticked off is a wonderful feeling lol!

I do this with many things, it's become second nature now and I think it helps me structure my day and keep productive. Hopefully it helps someone :)

<strong>P.S</strong>. ah yes about those spiders, since moving into a new house I've seen more spiders in 4 days than I saw in 2 weeks! Caught a glimpse of the huntsman spider too, what a giant beast! Find more pictures as I put them up on my <a title="http://instagram.com/carlo_c/" href="http://instagram.com/carlo_c/" target="_blank">instagram!</a>

I'll write a proper post about what I find different so far from work here and in the UK after a couple more weeks of it. Hopefully will have a new set of photos to put up too!
