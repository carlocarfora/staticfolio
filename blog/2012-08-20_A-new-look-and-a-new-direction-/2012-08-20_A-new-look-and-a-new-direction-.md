I've had a rebrand. Actually, I've had a bit more than a rebrand. <strong>A change in the way I want to lead my life</strong>.

As well as the new look and <a title="About" href="http://www.carlocarfora.co.uk/about">about</a>Â page, I've been reflecting on where I am in life and what I'm doing. I never thought or imagined myself being the person who commutes into and out of Central London every day, spending an hour on public transport and wishing I had "more free time" to work on and do things I'd like to.

<strong>It's time to change things</strong>, time to stop simply going through the path of least resistance and liveÂ (thanks to <a title="Sean Ogle" href="http://www.seanogle.com">Sean Ogle</a> for that one).

Now I'm not against working hard, I've worked hard throughoutÂ university, my professional career and I'll continue to for as long as I can. What I'm hoping to do is work on my terms. Travelling and working has always seemed like anÂ unattainableÂ dream but now I see it as another goal I can work towards if I have the desire and passion t0 do so.

Stay tuned for more news, there are some <strong>big</strong> changes happening.
