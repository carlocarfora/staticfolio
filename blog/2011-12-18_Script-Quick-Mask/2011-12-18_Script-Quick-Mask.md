I put together a script for a friend who wanted a quick way to render masks from selected objects. Really handy for selection masks in Photoshop, it can be a bit of a drag setting up quick black and white materials, assigning them to your objects etc.

Drag and drop to install, add it to your shelf and to use just select some objects and hit the button. It'll use your current render settings so if you've got it ticked to save your file it will prompt you in case of overwriting!
