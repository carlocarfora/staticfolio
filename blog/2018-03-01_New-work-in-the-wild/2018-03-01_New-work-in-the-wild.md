Since my last post I've put another project up on my site which I was a part of 
at The Mill, [O2 Follow the Rabbit](http://www.carlocarfora.co.uk/25_O2_Follow_The_Rabbit.html). I had the chance to do 
some sims in Houdini which was a lot of fun.

I've also put up some updated information on my Houdini notes github 
[wiki](https://github.com/carlocarfora/houdini-notes/wiki), and in a little bit 
of work downtime I put together a basic VEX raytracer which is up on the wiki. 
You can check out on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/256054658) too.

I'm currently diving into C++ with the eventual aim this year to write a basic 
raytracer, to really understand the rendering process and get a deeper 
understanding of how it all works.
