It's been a while coming but I'm happy to say that I have finally finished my new showreel which has the best parts of projects I've worked on over the past 5+ years. Take a look at it below!

In other big news, I have moved back to the UK for the next couple of years as my visa in Australia has come to an end. I'll write up more about it but safe to say now I'm back in London I'll be hoping for some opportunities in Film :)
